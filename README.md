# SEO-for-Events-in-netFORUM
This code creates JSON-LD structured data to insert into event web pages. It is intended to be used on a netFORUM CMS page detail. The JSON-LD XSL library can be used with non-netFORUM applications. 

The JSON-LD is extracted mainly from the itemtype and itemprop attributes on the XML. 

Future versions of the JSON-LD library will have greater tolerance for null or missing elements and allow for more complex @context nodes.
